Twelve NCAA Division I college men's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament.\\nThe championship game was played at Maryland's home field, Byrd Stadium, in front of 26,229 fans. The game saw Syracuse University defeat University of Maryland by the score of 13–9. Despite the loss, Maryland goalie Brian Dougherty was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Dougherty was outstanding in the semi-finals, showing why he earned the award as Division I goalie of the year, making 23 saves on 59 shots. In the first quarter, Hopkins' attack took 19 shots with Dougherty making 12 saves, allowing Maryland to take a 4-1 first-quarter lead.\\nIn the finals, Maryland led 4 to 2 with a minute left in the first half before the Orange exploded to three straight goals to claim a 5-4 half time lead and that momentum led to the victory. Dougherty again had 23 saves in the finals.\\nDespite being on the losing side, Maryland goalie Brian Dougherty was named most\\noutstanding player.
